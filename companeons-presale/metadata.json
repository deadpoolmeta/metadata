  "description": "Companeons Pre-Sale Mint Pass (CPMINT) is a non-fractional SPL voucher (0 decimals) issued 1:1 to pre-sale buyers of Companeons NFTs. Each pass guarantees the right to mint 1 Companeon NFT during the Pre-Sale window on September 30, 2025. Redeem by connecting your wallet on the official mint site; the pass is burned on redemption to prevent reuse. Transferable until redemption. This pass is not $COMP and confers no financial or governance rightsâ€”it serves purely as proof-of-allocation and mint access within the Companeons DAO ecosystem.",
